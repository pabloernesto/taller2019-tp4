// class. This class provides continuous reading/writing over a network
// connection, and sinchronization of the shared resource.

// Note: Since both Sender and Receiver are implementation details
// for EC, and not really meant as part of the module's public interface,
// I've used public attributes liberally.

// to the network connection.
